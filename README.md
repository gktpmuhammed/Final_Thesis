# Final_Thesis
This paper mainly focuses on the segmentation of MRI images and the creation
of a usable image dataset for the tumor detection and VI-RADS scoring mechanism.
We described the related works on MRI segmentation and tumor detection
algorithms with convolutional neural networks. We explained our approach for
segmenting MRIâ€™s using Mask RCNN and giving VI-RADS scores for lesions in
bladder wall.
The main application area of our project will be on detecting bladder cancers and
determining VI-RADS scores using MRI images and deep learning techniques.In
this paper, we have put forward a general approach and discussed the tools and
methods generally used in MRI handling.
